	Package waf provides an API for managing Web Application Firewall for the EdgeCast CDN.
	WAF  provides a layer of security between security threats and your external web infrastructure.

	The Web Application Firewall (WAF) service provides a layer of security
	between many security threats and your external web infrastructure.
	Our WAF increases security by monitoring, detecting, and preventing application
	layer attacks. It inspects inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic against reactive and
	proactive security policies and blocks malicious activity in-band and on a real-time basis.

	For more information about WAF, refer to: https://docs.vdms.com/cdn/index.html#HTTP_and_HTTPS_Data_Delivery/WAF/Introduction.htm
