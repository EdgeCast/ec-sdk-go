# Go SDK for EdgeCast CDN
This is the official Go SDK for EdgeCast. It contains services that interact 
with the EdgeCast APIs.

## Dependencies
- Go 1.16

## Installing
### $GOPATH
To install the SDK into your $GOPATH:
```
go get -u github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go
```

### Go Modules
```
go get github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go
```

## Using the SDK
Simply import the SDK and provide the API credentials provided to you. They may 
be an API Token or OAuth 2.0 Credentials. Examples are listed below for each 
feature.

### Customer management ###

Our Customer Management service provides administrative operations to manage 
Customer accounts and Customer User accounts for a Partner. These operations 
allows a partner to automate administrative tasks on their customers and 
customer user accounts. 

To use this Customer Management service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Customer

Customer Account Management Operations allows management of customer accounts

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials)
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	newCustomer := customer.Customer{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := customer.NewAddCustomerParams()
	addParams.Customer = newCustomer
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomer(*addParams)
	// ...
}
```

#### Customer User

Customer User Account Management Operations allows management of user accounts 
under a (parent) customer.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/customer"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials)
	customerService, err := customer.New(sdkConfig)
	customerUser := customer.CustomerUser{
		// ...
	}
	addCustomerUserParams := customer.NewAddCustomerUserParams()
	addCustomerUserParams.CustomerUser = customerUser
	// ...
	resp, err := customerService.AddCustomerUser(*addCustomerUserParams)
	// ...
}
```

### Edge CNAME ###

Our User-Friendly URL, also known as Edge CNAME, takes advantage of an Edge CNAME 
configuration and a CNAME record to provide a friendlier alternative to a CDN URL. 
An edge CNAME URL is specific to the platform from which it was configured.

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Creating_an_Alias_for_a_CDN_URL.htm)

To use the edge CNAME service, use the API Token providede to you.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials))
	cnameService, err := waf.New(sdkConfig)
	cname := edgecname.EdgeCname{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := edgecname.NewAddEdgeCnameParams()
	addParams.EdgeCname = cname
	// ...
	resp, err := edgecnameService.AddEdgeCname(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Customer Origins 

Our Customer Origin Service allows to serve content stored or generated by 
third-party web servers (e.g., web hosting) via the CDN by:

Creating a customer origin configuration. This type of configuration maps one 
or more servers to a CDN URL.
(Optional) Creating an edge CNAME configuration that allows you to serve traffic 
via the CDN without having to update your links. This type of configuration maps 
a customer origin configuration to a CNAME record.

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Origin_Server_-_File_Storage/Customer_Origin_Server.htm)

To use the Customer Origins service, use the API Token provided to you.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/edgecname"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials)
	originService, err := origin.New(sdkConfig)
	newOrigin := origin.Origin{
		// ...
	}
	addParams := origin.NewAddOriginParams()
	// ...
	addParams.Origin = newOrigin
	resp, err := originService.AddOrigin(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Route DNS - BETA ###

Our Route (DNS) solution is a reliable, high performance, and secure DNS service 
that provides capabilities such as:

Load balance traffic for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone hosted 
on another DNS system.
Establish a failover system for a CNAME record or a subdomain for a primary zone 
hosted on another DNS system.
Create a standard DNS zone. Optionally, load balance or failover requests to 
that zone.
Import a secondary DNS zone by creating a master server group and a secondary 
zone group.
Verify a server's capability to fulfill requests through health checks performed 
from around the world.

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#Route/Route_DNS.htm%3FTocPath%3DRoute%2520(DNS)%7C_____0)

To use the Route(DNS) service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Master Server Group

A master server group allows quick and easy management of master name servers, 
while a secondary zone group defines 
the secondary zones that will be imported from servers defined in a master 
server group and any TSIG keys 
that should be used for the zone transfer.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/routedns"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials)
	routeDNSService, err := routedns.New(sdkConfig)
	masterServerGroup := buildMasterServerGroup()
	addParams := routedns.NewAddMasterServerGroupParams()
	addParams.MasterServerGroup = masterServerGroup
	// ...
	resp, err := routeDNSService.AddMasterServerGroup(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Real Time Log Delivery (RTLD)

Our Real-Time Log Delivery (RTLD) servicee delivers log data in near real-time 
to a variety of destinations.

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#RTLD/RTLD.htm%3FTocPath%3DReports%2520and%2520Log%2520Data%7CReal-Time%2520Log%2520Delivery%7C_____0).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.

#### Real-Time Log Delivery Rate Limiting (RTLD Rate Limiting)

Delivers log data that describes requests for which Web Application Firewall (WAF) 
enforced a rate limit as defined through a rate rule.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("", idsCredentials)
	rtldService, err := rtld.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := profiles_rl.NewProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSettingParams()
	addParams.SettingDto = &rtldmodels.RateLimitingProfileDto{
		// ...
	}
	addResp, err :=
		rtldService.ProfilesRl.ProfilesRateLimitingAddCustomerSetting(addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Rules Engine

Our Rules Engine allows the customization of requests handled by our CDN. 
Sample customizations that may be performed are:

Override or define a custom cache policy
Secure or deny requests for sensitive content
Redirect requests to a different URL

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.whitecdn.com/cdn/index.html#HRE/HRE.htm).

To use the Rules Engine service, use OAuth 2.0 Credentials.
A Policy should be constructed as a JSON object passed as a string.

```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	policyString := `{
		// ...
	}`
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("", idsCredentials)
	rulesengineService, err := rulesengine.New(sdkConfig)
	addParams := rulesengine.NewAddPolicyParams()
	addParams.PolicyAsString = policyString
	addPolicyResp, err := rulesengineService.AddPolicy(*addParams)
// ...
}
```

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Our WAF service provides a layer of security between many security threats and 
your external web infrastructure. WAF increases security by monitoring, detecting, 
and preventing application layer attacks. It inspects inbound HTTP/HTTPS traffic 
against reactive and proactive security policies and blocks malicious activity 
in-band and on a real-time basis.

For more information, please read the [official documentation](https://docs.edgecast.com/cdn/index.html#Web-Security/Web-Security.htm%3FTocPath%3DSecurity%7CWeb%2520Application%2520Firewall%2520(WAF)%7C_____0).

To use the WAF service, use the API Token provided to you.

#### Access Rules
An access rule identifies legitimate traffic and threats by ASN, Cookie, Country, 
IP Address, Referrer, URL, User agent, HTTP method, Media type, File extension, 
and Request headers.
```
import (
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast"
	"github.com/EdgeCast/ec-sdk-go/edgecast/waf"
)
// ...
	sdkConfig := edgecast.NewSDKConfig("MY API TOKEN", idsCredentials))
	wafService, err := waf.New(sdkConfig)
	rule := waf.AccessRule{
		// ... 
	}
	resp, err := wafService.AddAccessRule(rule)
// ...
}
```
